## Bugs
<ul>
<li>Tried launching the preview from the terminal in github but I was not able to see anything on the preview only a blank page. Then i tried launching the preview in VSC and that made it work after that it has worked fine. 
<li>Tried to set the main content to text-align:center but when checking the accessibility score of the website it got lower. So I changed it to align-justify wich made the score even lower then i changed it to align-left instead for better accessibility on the website.</li>

## What I wanted to do
One thing I wanted to do was add a a background image to the forum page so it would have looked better for laptop/pc users. So that the forum was in a block and easy to read but the empty right part of the screen was a relaxing image. The layout of the forum page on mobile and tablet is good and did not need any additional image to make the page look more livly. Also wanted to add background image to header but it made the accessibility score go down since the logo was hard to see, I could have made a logo picture that had a background wich made it easy to read out but I did not have time.
